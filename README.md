# DynatraceSyntheticConverter

This project aims to provide a CLI for downloading, generating, validating, and uploading synthetic monitors from Dynatrace JSON schema to python scripts directly usable in AppDynamics synthetics.

## Usage

DynatraceSyntheticConverter can be invoked with the command `python3 DynatraceSyntheticConverter.py`
```
Usage: dynatraceSyntheticConverter.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  DT synthetic commands

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  generate  Generate python scripts from Dynatrace synthetic monitor JSON.
  upload    Upload generated scripts to AppD.
  validate  Validates generated scripts by running them locally.
```
### Commands


It is advised to execute the script with commands in the following order:
1. generate
2. validate
3. upload

Generate
```
Usage: dynatraceSyntheticConverter.py generate [OPTIONS]

  Generate python scripts from Dynatrace synthetic monitor JSON. Generated
  scripts are placed in the output directory and will overwrite existing
  scripts of the same name.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

Validate
```
Usage: dynatraceSyntheticConverter.py validate [OPTIONS]

  Validates generated scripts by running them locally. Creates report.csv in
  the output directory.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

Upload
```
Usage: DynatraceSyntheticConverter.py upload [OPTIONS]

  Upload generated scripts to AppD. If only-useful-scripts is chosen, only
  scripts from the output/report.csv which ranSuccessfully will be uploaded.

Options:
  --host TEXT                acme.saas.appdynamics.com
  --port TEXT                SaaS: 443 On Prem: 8090

  --username TEXT            must use local account
  --password TEXT
  --only-successful-scripts  Only scripts from the output/report.csv which
                             ranSuccessfully will be uploaded.

  --overwrite                Overwrite scripts on destination controller with

  --help                     Show this message and exit.
```

## Output
Executing `generate` will read all Dynatrace synthetic monitor JSON files from the `input` directory and create corresponding `.py` files in the `output` directory.

Executing `validate` will generate 'report.csv' in the `output` directory containing for each job whether it ran successfully and whether it contains custom code to be hand implemented. 

## Requirements

- chromedriver installed to your PATH
